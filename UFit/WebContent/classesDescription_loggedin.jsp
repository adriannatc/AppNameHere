	 				<div>
					 	Olympic Weightlifting is the sport of Strength, Power, Speed and Precision. In competition, the lifts are comprised of the Snatch and the Clean & Jerk - both of which are efforts to lift the maximum amount of weight from ground to overhead in two distinct ways. In training, weightlifting and accessory exercises challenge the mind and body to grow strong and powerful through repetition after repetition of the basics.

	 				<h3><strong>Capoeira</strong></h3>
	 				<div>
					 	Capoeira is the name given to the vibrant Afro-Brazilian art form that was developed in the 17th century by African slaves and their descendants. It is unlike any other martial art, in that it is 'played' (rather than fought) in a circle, to the accompaniment of live instruments, singing and clapping. Capoeira's dance-like movements are beautiful to watch, as they are based on achieving harmony with one's partner, exploring this dynamic in a safe, but challenging way. They teach grace, agility, flexibility, strength and endurance, as well as promoting a healthy relationship with others.
