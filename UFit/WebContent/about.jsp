 				<h2>About</h2>
 				<h1>About</h1>
				Our website aims to provide users with the means of looking for a suitable gym and fitness class at a suitable location, from classes at on-campus fitness facilities to off-campus locations. To start, users will be able to provide personal information and preferences that will be used to help find desired classes. Users will also be able to look through details and specifications regarding all classes to help make a decision. All the relevant information of classes that users register for will be conveniently compiled for users to refer to, with the ability to make adjustments. 
				<h2>Team</h2>
				The team is a group of seven Industrial Engineering Students at the University of Toronto. This website was created for an Information Systems course as a tool to develop a Dynamic Page website. Members are: Janelle Cuevas, Adrianna Tutak-Carty, April Luna, Can Alver, Naz Gozegir, Perry Huang and Mahir Khan.
